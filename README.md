# ecommerce-website

This is an ecommerce website I am creating with PHP and the Mod ReWrite of Apache. The purpose of this is to practice working with apache directly.
The Apache docs say that apps in production it is ideal to use the Apache Config directly. However, this is just a practice for me trying to get more familiar with Apache. I am still in the planning stages of creating my routes and controllers and they will be added soon.
